#### Project Philosophy
As an adrenaline junkie and avid explorer of the outdoors, I have often organized expeditions that require more complex organization and financial resources. Unfortunately, looking for sponsorship funds is a tedious and time-consuming task which removes the focus from the essence: Exploring!

Brands on the other hand are more than ever looking for unique and authentic stories to relate themselves to or showcase their products. Often however, companies lack the proper tools to structure these sponsorship requests, screen the applicants and follow up on the return on investment.

Home To Horizon aims to create a marketplace for sponsorship requests.
* __Explorers__ can create a detailed profile for their project, link their different media (Facebook page, Instagram account, Twitter handle, etc.) and request sponsorship in an efficient and convenient way.
* __Brand Managers__ receives the request with key performance indicators on audience size and its fit with the company's policy. He/she can then easily benchmark different projects and grand the fund, gear or other with a few simple clicks.
